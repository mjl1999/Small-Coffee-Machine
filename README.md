# Small-Coffee-Machine
A program designed to mimic the basic functionality of a coffee machine -  A day 15 challenge in 100 days of python

It demonstrates my knowledge of basic building blocks of coding: try/except blocks, if/else, booleans, creating my own functions, creating and importing my own basic libraries etc.

Surprisingly, I didn't find this project as hard as I thought I would. Admittedly, I was provided the basic list of functions the program should perform:
1) allow the user to select from a list of 5 options - three coffees, an "exit program" option, and a list of the remaining ingredients
2) to request a corresponding amount of money for the drink, to then either take this money from the user and return change or inform the user they did not enter enough.
3) to make the coffee drink and then subtract the resources required to make the drink from the remaining amount of ingredients 
4) to end the program once no more coffees were capable of being made.

Aside from the above outlined steps, all the code and the thought process behind it is a reflection of my level at the time of completion.

Anyway, fancy a brew?
