# Small-Coffee-Machine
A program designed to mimic the basic functionality of a coffee machine.

It demonstrates my knowledge of basic building blocks of coding: try/except blocks, if/else, booleans, creating my own functions, creating and importing my own basic libraries etc.

Surprisingly, I didn't find this challenge as hard as I thought I would. No doubt thanks to my credit card and blackjack programs - the former making me more comfortable with creating my own functions, while the latter (perhaps most importantly) made me more comfortable with creating my own step by step process for solving new challenges (courtesy of blackjack and all the stress that entailed at the time - see the blackjack readme).

I think the biggest strength i demonstrated to myself in this project - though not demonstrated in the code itself - was simply the act of pacing myself and knowing when to take breaks. I would say that this project represented a turning point in my understanding that the act of coding/programming isn't something you can brute force, and it's no surprise that by taking this challenge at a much more relaxed pace, it ended up turning out to be the least stressful to code.

I can also say that this was the first project where I actually had to understand how to retrieve and amend dictionary data within an actual program. This was something that was quite intimidating to me prior to the project, solely based on the fact that I had never done so before. 

Anyway, fancy a brew?
