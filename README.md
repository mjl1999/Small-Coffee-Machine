# Small-Coffee-Machine
A program designed to mimic the basic functionality of a coffee machine -  A day 15 challenge in 100 days of python

It demonstrates my knowledge of basic building blocks of coding: try/except blocks, if/else, booleans, creating my own functions, creating and importing my own basic libraries etc.

Surprisingly, I didn't find this project as hard as I thought I would. Admittedly, I was provided the basic list of functions the program should perform:
1) allow the user to select from a list of 5 options - three coffees, an "exit program" option, and a list of the remaining ingredients
2) to request a corresponding amount of money for the drink, to then either take this money from the user and return change or inform the user they did not enter enough.
3) to make the coffee drink and then subtract the resources required to make the drink from the remaining amount of ingredients 
4) to end the program once no more coffees were capable of being made.

Aside from the above outlined steps, all the code and the thought process behind it is a reflection of my level at the time of completion.

I think the main reason why I found this easier than prior projects is no doubt thanks to my credit card and blackjack programs - the former making me more comfortable with creating my own functions, while the latter (perhaps most importantly) made me more comfortable with creating my own step by step process for writing code (courtesy of blackjack and all the stress that entailed at the time - see the blackjack readme).

I think the biggest strength i demonstrated to myself in this project - though not demonstrated in the code itself - was simply the act of pacing myself and knowing when to take breaks. I would say that this project represented a turning point in my understanding that the act of coding/programming isn't something you can brute force, and it's no surprise that by taking this challenge at a much more relaxed pace, it ended up turning out to be the least stressful to code.

I can also say that this was the first project where I actually had to understand how to retrieve and amend dictionary data within an actual program. This was something that was a little intimidating to me prior to the project, solely based on the fact that I had never done so before. 

Anyway, fancy a brew?
